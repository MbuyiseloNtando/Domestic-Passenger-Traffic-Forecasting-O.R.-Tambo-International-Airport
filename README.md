# **✈️ Domestic Passenger Traffic Forecasting – O.R. Tambo International Airport**
**📌 Project Overview**

This project aims to forecast monthly domestic passenger traffic at O.R. Tambo International Airport using econometric and demographic indicators.

The goal is to understand the drivers of passenger demand and build predictive models to improve forecasting accuracy for aviation planning and resource allocation.

**Source:** STATS SA

Ectracted data from screenshots taken from Statistics South Africa reports using ChatGTP.


**Econometric & Demographic Data**

**GDP**

**Source:** International Monetary Fund

**Population**

**Source:** World Bank Open Data

**CPI**
